On this page you will find a **step-by-step guide for becoming a Liquidity Provider** in a Basilisk XYK pool. Providing liquidity allows you to **earn rewards** from the fees generated by trades in the pool.

This guide covers both processes of [adding](#add) and [withdrawing](#withdraw) liquidity.

Before deciding to become a liquidity provider, we encourage you to visit our XYK product page and to **get yourself familiar** with the features and caveats of XYK pools.

### Step 0: Bridge Tokens {#add-0-bridge}
Before you can provide liquidity for a pool with BSX and aUSD or KSM, you will first need to **bridge these non-native assets** into the Basilisk chain. For this purpose, you can use the [Karura Bridge](https://apps.karura.network/bridge).

The bridge can also be used to transfer BSX, aUSD or KSM out of the Basilisk chain and into Karura or Kusama.

For a step-by-step guidance on transfering tokens between Kusama chains, please visit our [bridging quide](/howto_bridge).

### Step 1: Navigate to Basilisk Pools Page {#add-1-navigate}

Connect your wallet to Basilisk by clicking **`Connect Account` (1 in image above)**.

### Step 3: Select Tokens and Add Liquidity {#add-3-add-liquidity}
Make sure that `Add` is selected in the toggle.
