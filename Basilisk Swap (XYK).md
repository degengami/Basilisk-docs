# Basilisk Swap (XYK)

Basilisk Swap is an AMM built for the Kusama ecosystem which enables users to trade tokens in a decentralized and permissionless manner. To achieve this, an array of so-called XYK pools can be deployed. Using these XYK pools, users can swap one token for another, or become a liquidity provider and earn rewards from the generated trading fees.

# A short intro into AMMs

In order to better understand Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and their functioning, we should first take a look at their centralized counterpart: Order Books.

## Order Books

Order Books provide a mechanism deployed by centralized exchanges to facilitate trading between two assets. Users can place a Buy or Sell order in an electronic list managed by the exchange. The orders in this so-called Order Book are organized by price level and progressively filled as demand shifts and orders are being matched.

The limitations of Order Books become apparent against the background of their centralized nature. The need for an intermediary to “keep” the Order Books and to facilitate the process of order matching creates a dependency on this central authority.

The central authority has control over the trading and needs to be trusted by the participants. In moments of high turbulence, halting of trading or liquidity withdrawals is not an uncommon mishap. Furthermore, the process of adding new tradable assets is permissioned meaning that is dependent upon the approval by the same authority which operates the Order Book.

## AMMs

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) is the answer of the DeFI industry to centrally operated Order Books. AMMs provide a decentralized, permissionless way of trading tokens without the need to subdue oneself to a central authority of control.

AMMs consist of liquidity pools that hold the available liquidity of the underlying tradable assets. This liquidity is provided by users (the so-called “liquidity providers”) who are incentivized to do so by the prospect of earning rewards from the fees generated by trades in the pool.

In the case of AMMs, any user can execute a Buy or Sell order on top of a given trading pool. The price of a trade is determined on the spot by a deterministic algorithm which takes as input the relationship between the liquidity of the traded assets, together with other factors which depend on the particular AMM implementation in question.

At Basilisk, we have an implementation of the the most standard AMM model - XYK, which is used to provide standard swap functionality. In the nearest future, we will deliver our implementation of Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP) which empowers young projects by allowing them to bootstrap initial liquidity, navigate price discovery and achieve a fair token distribution.

# XYK Pools: Powering the Swap Use-Case

XYK is the most common AMM model which is used to facilitate swaps from one asset to another. An XYK pool typically consists of a pair of tradable tokens, for example aUSD-BSX. The relationship between the two assets is expressed by the so-called “constant product” formula from which also the name of the XYK model has been derived: 

`x * y = k`

Given a `aUSD-BSX` liquidity pool, `x` represents the reserve liquidity of `aUSD` while

The naming comes from the so-called “constant product” formula which governs the functioning of these AMM model: `x * y = k`

In other words, the

The most common type of liquidity pool structure available on an AMM is that of a XYK pool, which is made up of reserves of two tokens.

This pair of tokens act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other based on the “constant product” formula `x * y = k`.

The formula simply states that trades must not change the product (`k`) of a pair’s reserve balances (`x` and `y`). This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at worse rates than smaller ones.

## Swapping Tokens

Token swaps in Basilisk are a simple way to trade one crypto asset for another.

For end-users, swapping is intuitive: a user picks an input token and an output token. They specify an input amount, and the protocol calculates how much of the output token they’ll receive based on the constant product formula mentioned above.

## Providing Liquidity

Because of the decentralized manner of an AMM, anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for a pool NFT. These NFTs track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.

LPs are rewarded with fees for providing this liquidity based on the trading activity experienced by this individual liquidity pool that they have selected to LP for.

## Impermanent Loss (IL)

A risk faced by LPs is called Impermanent loss (or divergence loss).

This is the risk of the difference in value between holding tokens in an AMM liquidity pool and holding them in your wallet.

Liquidity pools consist of multiple tokens (usually two) paired together in a pool. IL occurs when the tokens inside the pool diverge in price. The greater the divergence, the greater the risk of negative returns for the pool's LPs.

The risk is referred to as "impermanent" because the loss is only realized when you withdraw your tokens from the pool. If the relative prices of tokens in the pool return to their original state when you deposited tokens, the loss is minimized or eliminated.

The losses become *permanent* the moment you withdraw your tokens, reducing your earnings and sometimes wiping out your entire share of profits. 

As such, LPs need to weigh the fees and rewards earned from being a LP versus simply holding your tokens in your wallet.
